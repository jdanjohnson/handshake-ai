## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Slate Blue (#708090) for a trustworthy, stable feel.
- Background color: Off-White (#F5F5F5), nearly the same hue as the primary color but desaturated and bright, to offer a clean, professional look.
- Accent color: Burnt Orange (#CC6633), approximately 30 degrees to the "left" of slate blue on the color wheel; higher saturation and brightness to contrast with the primary and background.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, to create a modern, neutral, and machined feel.
- Use clean, professional icons for offer creation, sharing, and the digital handshake.
- A minimalist layout with clear, intuitive navigation, and generous use of whitespace to make complex legal terms easy to digest.
- A subtle, satisfying animation upon successful digital handshake to provide positive feedback to the user.
