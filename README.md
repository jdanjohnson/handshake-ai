# Handshake Legal 🤝⚖️

Welcome to a cozy little corner of the internet where **Next.js meets Firebase Studio**, powered by some clever **Genkit AI magic** ✨  
Think of this project as a fast, fun digital playground — built in a few hours as a one-shot experiment and shared as a code sample.

This is **not** a production legal tool. It’s a lightweight prototype meant for learning, remixing, and shipping ideas quickly.
